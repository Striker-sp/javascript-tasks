Async-Await : 
async function always returns a promise.
async function myFunc( ) { .... }
await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled.

IIFE : Immediately Invoked Function Expression 
To get rid of myFunc() written on console screen
It is Immediately defined as soon as function is made
ex: (async func api (){ ... })();
